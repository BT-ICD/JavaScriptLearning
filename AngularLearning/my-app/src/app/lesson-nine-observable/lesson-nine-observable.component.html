                An observable is any stream of data. Any time you hear the word observable, think stream or conveyor of data. 
                We could create an observable using the observable constructor, but the recommended technique is to use built-in creation function. Of is one such function. Of creates an observable using a set of defined values, emitting each value and then completing the stream.

            Observer- An interface for a consumer of push-based notifications delivered by an Observable.

               <p>
                An observer observes the stream. It processes notifications from the stream and provides functions for reacting to those notifications. Any time you hear the word observer, think a set of methods to observe and respond to the stream.

                Subscribing to an Observable is like calling a function, providing callbacks where the data will be
                delivered to.

                <h4>Executing Observables</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Next notification: sends a value such as a Number, a String, an Object, etc.</li>
                    <li>Error notification: sends a JavaScript Error or exception.</li>
                    <li>Complete notification: does not send a value.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
                "Next" notifications are the most important and most common type: they represent actual data being
                delivered to an subscriber. "Error" and "Complete" notifications may happen only once during the
                Observable Execution, and there can only be either one of them.
